			<h1>02 - Installation - WordPress</h1><a href="#toc"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i>Table of Contents</a>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>If you are new to WordPress, then installing it might seem like a daunting task. Thankfully, a lot
		of web hosts offer a one-click install that will do all the heavy lifting for you! Each web
		host differs from one another, so if you are unsure, then you should contact them and they
		will help you through the process.</p>
		<p>The option to install WordPress on your server is found somewhere in the menu when you
		log in to your web hosts control panel. Its sometimes found in the form of a CGI script.</p>
		<img src="images/web-host-panel.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>The above example is from Heart Internet's control panel. You might see something similar to this. Choose the
		WordPress option and it will usually prompt you to select a path to install it to. From here you can follow
		some simple steps, like creating a new username and password, and then that should be all you need to do!</p>
		<p>Once you have logged in to your WordPress admin dashboard, it is highly recommended to update to
		the latest version if you get prompted to do so. You should also update your plugins and other themes
		to their latest versions too. Once everything has been updated, you should go to your <strong>Settings</strong>
		menu and configure all relevant options in there.</p>
		<h5>Installing WordPress Manually</h5>
		<p>If you prefer, you can install WordPress yourself manually. The absolute best place to start is
		to follow the instructions outlined in the codex, which can be found <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<h5>Important Note</h5>
		<p>The latest version of WordPress, as of writing this, is currently 4.1
		Please note that the theme will refuse to function and switch back to the default theme if you don't
		have the latest version of WordPress. This is because the theme uses some of the newer functionality
		that has only just been introduced in version 4.1.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>With WordPress installed and updated, you can now begin to install the theme. In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to
		<strong>Appearance</strong> then click on <strong>Themes</strong>. This will take you to the <strong>Themes</strong> page.
		You should now see a list of themes to choose from with the option to add a new one (you can't miss it, its a big box that
		says "Add New Theme"!). Go ahead and click on that.</p>
		<img src="images/add-theme.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>You will now be on the <strong>Add Themes</strong> page. Next, click on <strong>Upload Theme</strong>.</p>
		<img src="images/upload-theme.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>It should now prompt you to upload a theme in a .ZIP file format. Click on the "Browse" button and select the zip file
		named "hungry-theme.zip" then click on <strong>Install Now</strong>.</p>
		<img src="images/browse-theme.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>This process may take a few minutes. Once the theme has been installed, you will have the option to view it in the <strong>
		Customizer</strong> or activate it. Viewing it in the Customizer will allow you to preview it and make a few
		customizations, just make sure that you activate it when you are finished.</p>
		<img src="images/activate-theme.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Now that your theme has been installed and activated, you should see a warning notice telling you to install some plugins.
		Please proceed on to the next chapter for instructions on what to do next.</p>
		<h5>Problems you Might Encounter</h5>
		<p>When uploading the theme (or any large file), you may encounter the following error message:</p>
<pre>
Maximum file size upload limit exceeded.
</pre>
		<p>This means that you cannot upload files that are higher than the maximum size limit, which could be as low as 2MB. This mostly
		depends on your web server. This can easily be fixed if you have FTP access and are able to edit either the "php.ini" file,
		or the ".htaccess" file.</p>
		<p>The following link will give you several different methods of how to resolve this. But if you really don't want to go and
		edit these files yourself, please contact your web host. They should be able to help you out in no time :)</p>

		<p><strong>Hungry</strong> makes use of three plugins, one of which is required to enhance functionality, while the other two
		are optional, but also enhances functionality. After installing the theme, you should now have a warning notice at the top
		of your page promting you to install plugins. Clicking on "Begin Installing Plugins" should automatically start downloading and
		installing the plugins.</p>
		<img src="images/install-plugins.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Once the plugins have been downloaded and unpacked, you will now have the option to install the plugins all at once. 
		To do this, check all the boxes and choose the
		"Install" option from the dropdown menu, then click on "Apply".</p>
		<img src="images/bulk-install.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Now all of your plugins should be installed, but they won't be activated yet. This is the next step. You should now
		see another notice saying that each of the plugins are currently inactive. So lets rectify that by clicking on 
		"Begin activating plugins".</p>
		<img src="images/activate-plugins.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>You will come to another screen with the option to "Bulk" install the plugins. So once again, check all the boxes like you
		did earlier, but this time select "Activate" from the dropdown menu, then click on "Apply".</p>
		<p>All of your plugins should now be activated and no further action is needed. If you visit your plugin page, you
		should see that these plugins are active. You can also deactivate plugins from this page too.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Also included in the download package is a child theme. Using a child theme is optional but if you
		plan to add your own functions and code, then it is highly recommended that you use this instead of modifying the
		main theme files. If you would like to know
		more about WordPress child themes, please visit the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank">Codex</a>.</p>
		<p>Child themes allow you to add your own code, functionality and styles without changing any of the main template files. This is
		especially useful when ever you update your theme because this means all of you chnages will remain intact. If you look in the
		main download package you will see a folder named "hungry-child". Simply copy this folder into your "themes" directory using
		an FTP client. Here's what your directory structure might look like with a child theme installed:</p>
<pre>
..
hungry
hungry-child
	| - style.css
	| - functions.php
</pre>
		<p>If you would rather not go down the FTP route, there are plugins available too. Here's a good place to

			<h1>06 - Importing Demo Content</h1><a href="#toc"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i>Table of Contents</a>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>This step is completely optional but if you'd rather have a load of demo content to play around with, then thats what
		this chapter is for. <strong>Hungry</strong> comes with a file that will import all the content you see on the
		demo site, minus the images. The images are replaced with placeholders instead as they are not licensed to be bundled
		with the theme. If you would like more information on where to download and purchase these images, please see the credits
		section further down at the end of this document.</p>
		<p>In your main download file, you will see a folder named "demo". This folder contains an XML file that is used to import
		all of the data needed. The file is called "hungry-demo-data.xml" and you will need this file a bit later on. Lets go through
		this process one step at a time.</p>
		<h5>Step 01</h5>
		<p>Firstly, navigate your way to <strong>Tools -> Import</strong>. This will take you to the <strong>Import</strong> screen. This
		handy tool will let you import content from a variety of different blogging platforms, but for this, we are going to select
		<strong>WordPress</strong>.</p>
		<img src="images/import.jpg" alt="" />
		<h5>Step 02</h5>
		<p>Once the WordPress option has been selected, you may be prompted to install the <strong>WordPress Importer</strong> plugin if you
		don't already have it. So if you need to, install this first by clicking on the "Install Now" button in the pop up window. Once
		the plugin has been downloaded and unpacked, you should activate and run the plugin when prompted to do so.</p>
		<h5>Step 03</h5>
		<p>You will now be taken to the <strong>Import WordPress</strong> page. You will need to click on the "Browse" button and locate
		the file "hungry-demo-data.xml" mentioned earlier. Once this has been selected, click on "Upload file and import". Don't forget to
		check the options you want to include, including media, and WordPress should start the import process. It may take a while depending
		on your connection speed.</p>
		<img src="images/browse-xml.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Thats all there is to it! You should have all the posts and pages that were seen in the demo site for you to configure to your
		hearts content.</p>
		<h5>A note about menus</h5>
		<p>Please be aware that if you choose to import the WordPress custom menus too, you will need to amend some of the custom
		link's URLs to reflect your own website's URL.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p><strong>Hungry</strong> comes with a powerful theme options panel courtesy of the <em>Redux Framework</em>. Throughout the
		option's pages, there are explanations on what each option does, so this will only be a quick overview.
		To access the theme options, simply click on the tab that says <strong>Hungry Options</strong> on
		the left. You can also access it directly through the admin bar at the top.</p>
		<img src="images/options-access.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>You can navigate through each options page using the menu on the left. Note that some of these menu tabs also have
		submenus that reveal more pages. Each option has a brief description of what it does and how it is configured so please
		take some time to have a read through each one to get a good idea of what to do.</p>
		<img src="images/options-general.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>You will also notice that each "built-in" section has its own options page, like the <strong>About Us</strong> section. This
		makes it easier for beginners to customize the look of their site without having to do any coding. Customizing the background
		slider is as easy as navigating to the <strong>Background Slider</strong> tab and tweaking the settings.</p>

	<div class="container">
		<p><strong>Hungry</strong> makes use of WordPress's custom header feature. These headers will appear on all pages except the homepage
		template, which uses a custom slider instead. To add a custom header, go to your admin area and click on <strong>Appearance
		</strong> then <strong>Header</strong> in the side menu. This will take you to the customizer screen (as of WordPress 4.1), where you
		can upload not just one, but multiple header images and randomly show different ones on each page if you want!</p>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Once you have the theme and plugins installed, we can now move on to the Homepage. The first thing you will need to do is create a new
		page. You can do this by navigating to the <strong>Pages</strong> tab on the left and either create a new page, or edit an existing one. To
		create a new page, click on <strong>Add New</strong>.</p>
		<img src="images/add-page.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>While editing the page, you will notice a section called <strong>Page Attributes</strong>. This is where you can select your
		page templates using the dropdown menu that says <strong>Template</strong>. From this menu, select the <strong>One Page Layout</strong>.</p>
		<img src="images/choose-template.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>This is kind of a special page template, so all of the post content and feature image will be ignored here, but not the page title. You 
		can call it whatever you like, but I would recommend calling it "Home" or something similar. Go ahead and click on <strong>Update</strong> to update your page
		or <strong>Publish</strong> if its a new page.</p>
		<p>Since your blog page is usually your default front page, we now need a seperate page to display your blog posts. So just like before, 
		click on your <strong>Pages</strong> tab and create a new page. Call this one "Blog", "News" or something similar and click <strong>Publish</strong>.
		Again, there's no need to enter any content. We're going to let WordPress handle this.</p>
		<p>Now you will need to visit your <strong>Settings</strong> page and select the <strong>Reading</strong> tab. You should now be on the <strong>
		Reading Settings</strong> page. For the <strong>Front Page Displays</strong> option you will need to select your "Home" page as your Front page,
		and select your "Blog" page as your blog page.</p>
		<img src="images/set-homepage.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Once all this is done, don't forget to click <strong>Save Changes</strong>! You can now visit your site and see the homepage. All the content you see
		is default content that can be edited through either the theme options panel, or elsewhere depending on the section you wish to edit. Please see one of
		the other chapters in this guide for further information.</p>

	<div class="container">
		<p><strong>Hungry</strong> comes with a robust homepage layout builder that allows you to swap, move, insert and remove
		any section you like. This is accessed through the theme options page by clicking on the <strong>Homepage</strong> tab.</p>
		<img src="images/home-layout.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>By default, the homepage template is built with two types of sections: Built-in sections and custom sections. Built-in
		sections are already available by default and can be customized in the theme options panel. Custom sections work differently
		however. This type of section uses content from your WordPress pages.</p>
		<p>The two columns that you see represent what is enabled and disabled for display on the homepage. You can use the mouse to
		drag blocks to re-order them or remove them completely. Custom sections are labelled with the name of your WordPress pages
		and are prefixed with a page icon.</p>
		<img src="images/drag-blocks.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Once you have all the sections where you want, don't forget to click on <strong>Save Changes</strong>. Here's a tip: If
		you need more control over a custom section's padding, edit the page itself and edit the options associated with the
		one-page layout, shown in the screenshot below.</p>

		<p>WordPress's cutom menus allows you to create same-page navigation as well as multi-page navigation. This chapter will
		cover the basics of WordPress menus and how to link to sections that are on the same page. First, navigate to
		<strong>Appearance -> Menus</strong>. This will take you to the "Edit Menus" screen.</p>
		<img src="images/edit-menus.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>From here you can begin building your custom menu. Give your menu a name, then click on "Create Menu". This will
		save your new menu so you can add it to a location. Now you can click on <strong>Manage Locations</strong> and
		select your newly created menu from the dropdown list and set it as your site's main navigation. Click on "Save Changes" when
		you're done.</p>
		<img src="images/manage-locations.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>When you visit your site now, you will see your new menu in the main navigation bar. You can put anything you like
		in your menus, including custom links. This is what we are going to need to do in order to link to sepearate sections
		on the same page.</p>
		<p>Go back to the "Edit Menus" screen from earlier and create a new menu item by clicking on the <strong>Links</strong> tab.
		For the URL field, type in the full URL of your site followed by a hash symbol (#) and then the name of the section's
		ID. For example, if you wanted to create a link to the "About Us" section, this is what your URL might look like:</p>
<pre>
http://www.exampleurl.com/#hungry-about-us
</pre>
		<p>The above example is based on if you set your one-page layout as your homepage. If it was a seperate page, then you would need
		to use the full URL of that page followed by the hash tag ending, like so:</p>
<pre>
http://www.exampleurl.com/seperate-page/#hungry-about-us
</pre>
		<p>The following is a list of all available built-in sections to link to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>About Us</strong> - <code>#hungry-about-us</code></li>
			<li><strong>Blog</strong> - <code>#hungry-blog</code></li>
			<li><strong>Gallery</strong> - <code>#hungry-gallery</code></li>
			<li><strong>Food Menu</strong> - <code>#hungry-menu</code></li>
			<li><strong>Reservations</strong> - <code>#hungry-reservations</code></li>
			<li><strong>Slogan 01</strong> - <code>#hungry-slogan-01</code></li>
			<li><strong>Slogan 02</strong> - <code>#hungry-slogan-02</code></li>
			<li><strong>Meet the Staff</strong> - <code>#hungry-staff</code></li>
			<li><strong>Testimonials</strong> - <code>#hungry-testimonials</code></li>
			<li><strong>Custom Section</strong> - <code>#hungry-custom-section-{ID}</code> - Replace {ID} with your page's ID number. This
			is a numeric value and can be found by hovering your mouse over the post's link.</li>
		</ul>

			<h1>12 - Adding Recipes</h1><a href="#toc"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i>Table of Contents</a>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Before you can add Menus and Recipes, you will need to make sure that the <strong>Hungry Plugin</strong> is installed
		and activated. If not, please go through chapter 02 on installing plugins first. You will be able to see the <strong>Recipes</strong> tab in the menu on the left when you are logged in to
		your WordPress admin.</p>
		<h5>Creating Menus</h5>
		<p>Creating menus for your recipes is very similar to creating categories for your regular WordPress posts. If you click
		or hover over the <strong>Recipes</strong> tab in the left hand menu, you will see the <strong>Menus</strong> option. Go ahead and click on that.</p>
		<img src="images/menus-tab.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>You should now be on the <strong>Menus</strong> page. You can add as many menus as you want and you can even assign recipes to several
		menus, not just one! Fill out the information required on the left and then click <strong>Add New Menu</strong>. These are the fields you
		need to fill in;</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name</strong> - This is a required field. The name of your menu.</li>
			<li><strong>Slug</strong> - Optional. If left blank, WordPress will create a slug name for you.</li>
			<li><strong>Description</strong> - Optional. This will only be displayed on Taxonomy pages.</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="images/menu-details.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>You don't have to create new menus this way, you can also create them while creating recipes. Just like adding categories in posts.
		It's completely up to you!</p>
		<h5>Creating Recipes</h5>
		<p>If you are already familiar with creating posts, then you are half way there! Click on your <strong>Recipes</strong> tab in the
		left and select <strong>Add New</strong>. This will take you to the <strong>Add New Recipe</strong> screen.</p>
		<img src="images/add-new-recipe.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>If you have been using WordPress for a while, this screen will look familiar to you. All of the basic fields you edit in regular posts can
		be found here too, but with a few extra ones. Lets begin by filling out our standard fields.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Title</strong> - Add a title for your recipe (e.g. Garlic Bread).</li>
			<li><strong>Content</strong> - Enter some content. This can be anything you like. Shortcodes are allowed.</li>
			<li><strong>Menus</strong> - Add this recipe to an exisitng menu, or create a new one. If you create a new one, you can edit
			it further in the <em>Menus</em> page mentioned ealier.</li>
			<li><strong>Featured Image</strong> - Just like normal posts, you can attach a featured image to each recipe. Ideally this should
			be a photo of the dish in question.</li>
			<li><strong>Excerpt</strong> - You can use this field to show a smaller description shown in the menu. If nothing is entered here,
			the first twenty words are used from your content instead.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The next set of options is where recipes differ from normal posts. Further down the page, there is another area with
		extra fields that are specific to recipes. Lets go through them one at a time.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Price on Menu</strong> - Enter a price for this recipe. The currency symbol can be changed in the theme options.</li>
			<li><strong>Featured Item</strong> - Check this option to make it a featured item on the menu. This simply styles it differently to
			other menu items so that it stands out more.</li>
			<li><strong>Link to recipe from menu</strong> - Check this option if you want to allow the user to visit the recipe's main page.</li>
			<li><strong>Tooltip Text</strong> - Tooltip text can be displayed when the user hovers over the price tab. Can be effective when
			used with the "Featured Item" option.</li>
			<li><strong>Warning Text</strong> - This can be used to display some useful info on the current dish, such as if it contains a
			certain ingredient, like nuts for example.</li>
			<li><strong>Widget Excerpt</strong> - This is only used with the <em>Latest Recipes</em> widget that is displayed in sidebars. Use
			it to show a brief description of the dish in just a few words.</li>
			<li><strong>Page Layout</strong> - Display the content on the left or right side of the page in the main post page.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Thats all there is to creating recipes! But what good are recipes without having a menu to show them on? Well, you can check
		out the next chapter on how to do this.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Once you have a good amount of recipes created, its time to show them on your site. There are two ways you can
		do this with this theme. The first and easiest way is to display them using the <strong>Food Menu</strong> section
		which you can edit in the theme options. The second way is to use a shortcode.</p>
		<h5>The simple way</h5>
		<p>There is a section on your <strong>One-Page</strong> template that is designed specifically for showing your
		food menus. Firstly, visit the theme options page in your admin area and click on the <strong>Section - Food Menu</strong>
		tab.</p>
		<img src="images/food-menu.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>You will have a few options here to play with, inlcuding how to sort each menu item. The sorting options use WordPress's
		own post sorting options. The main option however, are the three columns and the layout option. You can assign menus to each
		column by selecting them from the dropdown menus. You can then choose either a one, two or three column layout. Once you
		have selected the menus you want to display, click on <strong>Save Changes</strong>. If you visit your site now, you should see
		the menus that were chosen.</p>
		<img src="images/menu-options.jpg" alt="" />
		<img src="images/menu-front-end.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>You can go back and change menus and layouts anytime you need. Simply remove the menu from the column by clicking on the 
		<strong>X</strong> icon found on the left of each menu item.</p>
		<h5>The shortcode way</h5>
		<p>If you prefer your menus to be on a seperate page and need to customize the layout a bit more, you can also use a shortcode.
		Here's an example:</p>
<pre>
[hungry-menu menu="Main Dishes"]
</pre>
		<p>The <code>menu</code> attribute is the name of the menu you wish to display. Please don't confuse this with the slug name for
		that menu. Make sure the name is exactly the way it is when you created the menu, including capital letters. You can even nest these
		shortcodes within column shortcodes for a more unique layout. See the chapter on shortcodes for more information on this.</p>
	</div>
	
	<!-- ################################################################## -->
	<div id="gallery" class="section-title">
		<div class="container">
			<h1>14 - Gallery</h1><a href="#toc"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i>Table of Contents</a>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p><strong>Hungry</strong> makes use of WordPress's native media uploader to manage your gallery in the gallery section of the
		one-page template. Go into your theme options page and select the <strong>Section - Gallery</strong> tab.</p>
		<img src="images/add-gallery.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>From here, you can use the <strong>Add/Edit Gallery</strong> button to add and sort images in your gallery. When you click
		on this button, the media upload screen will appear. You will need to click on "Add to Gallery" from the menu on the left in order
		to select your images. When you select an image, you will notice an extra <strong>Class</strong> field under the usual caption
		and description fields. You can enter a class name of "wide" here (without the quotes) to make your image span accross
		two columns.</p>
		<img src="images/edit-gallery.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>The theme uses the jQuery Masonry plugin to layout your images automiatically, but if you find that your images are not
		displaying in the order you intended, go back and edit your gallery and re-order them. Sometimes it takes a little trial and
		error.</p>

			<h1>15 - Custom Widgets</h1><a href="#toc"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i>Table of Contents</a>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p><strong>Hungry</strong> comes with three custom widgets to display in your sidebar and footer. Sidebars can
		be configured by navigating to <strong>Appearance -> Widgets</strong> in your WordPress admin. If you need more
		information on what WordPress widgets are and how they work, please visit the 
		<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets" target="_blank">WordPress codex</a>.</p>
		<img src="images/widgets-screen.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>The <strong>Hungry - Contact Details</strong> widget is useful for displaying contact details such as your email,
		work address, and telephone number. Simply drag the widget to the desired sidebar and then fill out all the fields.
		Don't forget to click "Save" when you're done!</p>
		<img src="images/widget.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>When visiting your site now, you should see the widget displayed in your chosen sidebar. In this example, I've selected
		one of the footer columns.</p>
		<img src="images/footer-widget.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>There are two more custom widgets you can use. The <strong>Hungry - Latest Recipes</strong> widget will display the
		latest entries in your recipes, including a thumbnail image and a short excerpt, which is configurable when editing
		the post. The <strong>Hungry - Opening Times</strong> widget allows you to display a list of opening hours for your
		business. You can wrap the times in <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags to align them to the right. You can also use
		<code>&lt;span class="closed"&gt;Closed&lt;/span&gt;</code> to display a closed sign instead.</p>

	<div id="shortcodes" class="section-title">
		<div class="container">
			<h1>16 - Shortcodes</h1><a href="#toc"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i>Table of Contents</a>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Shortcodes have been around for a while in WordPress. They provide you with a way to insert content into your posts and
		pages that would require additional code such as HTML or PHP. They are usually wrapped in square brackets and have a unique name.
		You don't have to type them all out manually either, thanks to the shortcode generator provided. You will find the shortcode
		generator button along with all the other controls in the editor window.</p>
		<img src="images/shortcodes-button.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Clicking on this will bring up a list of all available shortcodes where you can also type in specific shortcode attributes too.</p>
		<img src="images/shortcode-atts.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Some shortcodes can be wrapped around other content in your post and some can even be nested. To learn more in depth about WordPress
		shortcodes and how they work, please visit the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API" target="_blank">Shortcode API</a> over at WordPress.
		Below is a list of all available shortcodes for this theme.</p>
		<h5>Columns</h5>
		<p>The column shortcode provides you with a way to layout your content using a grid system. There are two types of this shortcode in the 
		shortcode generator. They are <strong>Simple</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong>. The advanced version simply provides you with
		more attributes to use, such as how you might want the layout to look on smaller screens. Here's a basic example:</p>
<pre>
[col grid="50" tgrid="100" mgrid="100"]

Custom content...

[/col]
</pre>
		<p>The example above will create a column that is 50% wide on desktop screens, but 100% wide on all over devices. The complete list
		of attributes you can use include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>grid</strong> - Width of the column in percentages and increments of 5.</li>
			<li><strong>tgrid</strong> - Width on Tablet view</li>
			<li><strong>mgrid</strong> - Width on Mobile view</li>
			<li><strong>pre</strong> - Space before the column (Prefix)</li>
			<li><strong>suf</strong> - Space after the column (Suffix)</li>
			<li><strong>dfirst</strong> - First column in a row on Desktop view</li>
			<li><strong>tfirst</strong> - First column in a row on Tablet view</li>
			<li><strong>mfirst</strong> - First column in a row on Mobile view</li>
			<li><strong>dlast</strong> - Last column in a row on Desktop view</li>
			<li><strong>tlast</strong> - Last column in a row on Tablet view</li>
			<li><strong>mlast</strong> - Last column in a row on Mobile view</li>
			<li><strong>dhide</strong> - Hide column on Desktop view</li>
			<li><strong>thide</strong> - Hide column on Tablet view</li>
			<li><strong>mhide</strong> - Hide column on Mobile view</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Food Menus</h5>
		<p>In addition to the theme options, you can also display menus using a shortcode. Here's an example:</p>
<pre>
[hungry-menu menu="Main Dishes"]
</pre>
		<p>The <code>menu</code> attribute is the name of the menu you wish to display. Please don't confuse this with the slug name for
		that menu. Make sure the name is exactly the way it is when you created the menu, including capital letters. You can even nest these
		shortcodes within column shortcodes for a more unique layout. Here's an example of two menus in two columns:</p>
<pre>
[col grid="50" tgrid="100" mgrid="100"]

	[hungry-menu menu="Main Dishes"]

[/col]
[col grid="50" tgrid="100" mgrid="100"]

	[hungry-menu menu="Desserts"]

[/col]
</pre>
		<h5>Divider</h5>
		<p>This will create a divider, usually used to seperate content. There are two types available, a normal one which displays
		a simple graphic, and one which uses a more subtle border. Here's an example:</p>
<pre>
[divider type="line"]
</pre>
		<h5>Intro Heading</h5>
		<p>The fancy headings you see at the top of some sections are also available as a shortcode too. Example usage:</p>
<pre>
[intro title="Main Title" subtitle="This is a Subtitle"]
</pre>
		<p>This is a self-closing shortcode, meaning you don't have to wrap it around any text.</p>
		<h5>Font Awesome List</h5>
		<p>Icons from the Font Awesome lirary are also available to use. A code snippet is available in the shortcode generator. Here's a list
		example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;ul class="fa-ul"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i class="fa-li fa fa-check"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;A List Item...&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i class="fa-li fa fa-check"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;A List Item...&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;i class="fa-li fa fa-check"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;A List Item...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
		<h5>Drop Caps</h5>
		<p>Go into <strong>Text</strong> mode. Wrap the first letter of a paragraph in <code>&lt;span class="hungry-dropcap"&gt;</code>. Example usage:</p>
<pre>
&lt;span class="hungry-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;his is the start of a paragraph...
</pre>

	<div class="container">
		<p><strong>Hungry</strong> makes use of the <strong>Open Table</strong> plugin by <em>Devin Walker</em>. This plugin
		can be seen in action on the demo site and can be used as a widget and a shortcode. It integrates with the Open Table
		API to allow visitors to make bookings for your restaurant (or any restaurant registered with Open Table for that
		matter!). If you would like to try it out, there is a free version available in the WordPress.org plugin repository.
		The version you see in the demo is the <strong>Pro</strong> version of the plugin, which has more options available.</p>
		<p>Below is a quick guide to using the widget and shortcode in your site, but first, be sure to check out
		the following links for more information and download.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.opentable.com/start/home" target="_blank">Open Table</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/open-table-widget/" target="_blank">Open Table Widget - Free Version</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://wordimpress.com/plugins/open-table-widget-pro/" target="_blank">Open Table Widget - Pro Version</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can download the free version by navigating to <strong>Plugins -> Add New</strong> and doing a search for
		"open table widget". To get the <strong>Pro</strong> version however, you will need to purchase a licence. This is
		recommended because you will get more features and full support from them.</p>
		<h5>Using as a Widget</h5>
		<p>After downloading and activating the plugin, go to your widgets page (Appearance -> Widgets) and you will see a new widget
		called <strong>Open Table Widget</strong>. Simply drag it to any of your sidebars and fill out the form. Don't forget to
		click "Save"!</p>
		<img src="images/open-table-widget.jpg" alt="" />
		<h5>Using as a Shortcode</h5>
		<p>The Pro version also has a shortcode available that you can insert it into any post or page. This is demonstrated in
		the demo site at the bottom of the page. To get the same result, go to <strong>Hungry Options -> Section - Reservations</strong> and
		insert the follwing code into the "Main Content" field.</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class="hungry-open-table"&gt;
[open-table-widget title="Booking Form" widget_style="bare-bones" max_width="100%" display_option="2" lookup_city="London, Manchester" pre_content="If you're new in town, why not use the form below to find one of our restaurants." post_content="Please allow up to 24 hours for a confirmation of your booking. Thanks!" time_start="5:00pm" time_end="9:30pm" time_increment="30" max_seats="8" label_city="Choose a City" label_date="Choose a Date" label_time="Choose a Time" label_party="How Many People?" input_submit="Find a Table!"]
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
		<p>As you can see, the shortcode is wrapped in <code>&lt;div class="hungry-open-table"&gt;</code>. This will allow the theme to
		style the form to blend in more with the look and feel of the theme. You can remove this is you prefer the original style of the
		widget.</p>
		<p>If you need more help with using this shortcode and its attributes, please visit the documentation that is available
		at their website <a href="https://wordimpress.com/docs/open-table-widget/#shortcode-usage" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>Hungry</strong> is translation ready. What this means is that all the text found throughout the theme can
		be easily translated by using translation software such as PoEdit. This chapter will give you a brief overview of how
		to go about making your own translations.</p>
		<h5>Download PoEdit</h5>
		<p>PoEdit is free translation software that can edit and configure .PO and .MO files. These files can be found in the
		<strong>languages</strong> folder which can be found inside the main theme folder. The first thing you will need to do
		is download and install PoEdit on your computer. You can get it <a href="http://poedit.net/" target="_blank">Right Here</a>.</p>
		<p>Once you have PoEdit installed, you can use it to open the "en_GB.po" file located in the "languages" folder. Here's
		what it should look like when you are editing the file in PoEdit:</p>
		<img src="images/poedit.jpg" alt="" />
		<h5>Making a Translation</h5>
		<p>To make a translation, simply click on one of the phrases in the list and then re-write the text in your chosen language in the "Translation"
		box below. You will need to do this for each phrase in the list. Once you have everything translated to your needs, don't
		forget to save your changes!</p>
		<p>If you need to change languages in WordPress, as of version 4.0, you can change this setting by navigating to
		<strong>Settings -> General</strong>.</p>
		<img src="images/languages.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Those are the bare the basics of translating a theme and switching languages. If you need more in-depth information on this you
		can view a whole article on it over at the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/localization/" target="_blank">WordPress Codex</a>.
		There is also a handy tutorial on this subject too over at <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/translating-your-theme--wp-25014" target="_blank">Tutsplus</a>.</p>
